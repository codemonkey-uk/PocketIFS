PocketIFS
=========

Create IFS / l-system fractals (trees, shells, coast lines, spirals) with ease. Includes PocketC source code. Requires latest version PocketC runtime (free) or compiler (shareware), available from http://www.orbworks.com/

"PocketIFS is a nice piece of software for the amateur applied mathematician. It allows you to create fractals based on mathematical functions. So you can imitate nature and create some incredible geometric fractals that go on and on. I made one crazy spiral.

Just select the type of fractal and program and off you go, IFS will generate the corresponding image. The software lacks options and additional functions but as a fun starter package it's fine. Maths has never been so fun."

PocketIFS is Palm OS software created in PocketC.

PocketIFS was the inspiration for this: http://www.wildvision.info/index.htm

The /companion/ folder contains C/C++ source code for rendering PocketIFS files on a modern unix-based OS, such as Linux or OS X.

Both rendering to a fixed recursive depth, and rendering iteratively for time is supported.
