Install
-------
PocketIFS is a PocketC applet, and requires the PocketC runtime to work.
The PocketC runtime is freely avaiable from http://www.orbworks.com/
Once PocketC is installed simply upload PocketIFS.PDB to your handheld 
device, to run PocketIFS run PocketC then select PocketIFS and press 
"Execute".

PocketIFS v0.3d was tested using PocketC v3.92

------------

This is an early version of PocketIFS which lets you play with 
IFS's, more information on IFS can be found on the web.  This 
document briefly describes how to use the PocketIFS applet.

1) When PocketIFS starts you are presented with a licence alert.  
(Feel free to remove it for personal use, but it must be present
if you distribute [copy & give to others] it).
Press OK to continue.

2) You are now in 'draw' mode, click using the pen to define the corners
of a shape, draw mode will be over once you have created a closed polygon.

3) Now you are in transform mode, which has 5 buttons at the top, 
from right to left they are:

  1) Rotate.
  2) Scale
  3) Move.
  4) Lock.
  5) Happy.

The first three are the three basic transformations that can be done, 
each stage starts on pen down, and ends on pen up.

Whist the pen is down you deform (a copy of) the original shape,
on the X and Y axis independently by moving the pen up & down, 
and left & right.

You can lock XY for rotation and scale using the Lock icon.

Once you are happy, select the happy face icon, which will confirm your 
selection.  Once you have confirmed that you are finished you will be 
asked if you want Another, if you say yes you will be returned to
transform mode with a new copy of the shape (and so create multiple 
transformations).

Once you have created all the transformations you want (only do one first 
time, I've never usefully used more than 3) PocketIFS will draw your fractal 
by recursively applying the transformations.

Enjoy!
